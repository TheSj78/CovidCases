# CovidCases
Android App I made that tracked Covid cases by country when COVID-19 was a pretty huge thing

My first android app!

I used Android Studio to make the app and tested on a Motorola device as well as virtual emulators.

Keeps track by countries

Gets data by scraping the website (hopefully not illegal ðŸ’€)

## Notes

Main code is in `app/src/java/`. 

Not on Play Store bc I didn't want to pay or anything, but it's still pretty cool! Now I can also use ReactNative and stuff so I'm more cross-platform.

## Other

Made this in 2020! Let me know if it doesn't work!
